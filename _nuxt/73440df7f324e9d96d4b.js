In\n      college we both took a class where we had to plan a vacation.\n      Coincidentally, we both drew Japan out of a hat, and conducted quite a\n      lot of research. So we have both independently planned our own ideal\n      vacation to Japan. We can't imagine anything better than combining\n      those plans for a honeymoon. While we are checking off those boxes, we will\n      also be spending a few days with Jakob's sister Arielle\n      and her family, who recently moved to Ota-Shi Gunma, Japan. We appreciate\n      anything you can contribute to making this dream vacation a reality. Donate\n      responsibly, and please don't feel like you have to give anything at\n      all. Your presence is a present!
