      <h3>Politics</h3>
      <p class="content left">
        We get it, it's an election year. This wedding is extremely close to election day.
        We have a politically diverse range of friends and family.
        There will be [🐘, 🐴, 🍃, 🦄, and more]. Don't be a 🍆. We're all equally 🦅.
        We ask that you set aside your differences and remember at least one thing you have in common: You're here for us, and we LOVE you!
        </br>
        So, when you feel the need to bring up politics simply imagine the other person agreeing with you, and move on.
        If someone is baiting you, feel free to bring it up with us, and we will address the situation appropriately.
        </br>
        If you can't put it aside for a few hours, consider diversifying your interests
        and feel free to decline the invitation. You are not exempt from this policy.
      </p>
      <h3>COVID-19</h3>
      <p class="content left">
        This has been an exceptionally hard year for all of us. While we are still planning on holding the ceremony this October
        we are also aware that stay-in-place orders may not be lifted by then. If that's the case here in Denver, we'll reschedule.
        While we would love to see each and every one of you, we understand that your lives and the lives of those you care most for
        in this world may not be worth the risk of attending. We want you to know that we won't be dissappointed if you decide you
        cannot attend for personal health reasons.
      </p>
      <h3>Limited Attendance</h3>
      <p class="content left">
        Max guest count is 78 per the venue, we can't control fire code. Our DIRECT family alone makes up 29 people.
        That's moms, dads, brothers, sisters, and sibling's children.
        Extend that to Grandparents, Cousins, Aunts, and Uncles and we are way over our guest count.
        If you believe for any reason you will be unable to attend, we would truly appreciate an early update.
        Feel free to call, text, send a raven, or email the RSVP link.
        Thank you!
        </br>
        </br>
        4/27/2020: We have sent out our save the dates. If you know for a fact that you can't make it, we would truly
        appreciate a heads-up. Declining early will allow us to send out a second round of invitations.
