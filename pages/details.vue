      <h3>Politics</h3>
      <p class="content left">
        We get it, it's an election year. This wedding is extremely close to election day.
        We have a politically diverse range of friends and family.
        There will be [🐘, 🐴, 🍃, 🦄, and more]. Don't be a 🍆. We're all equally 🦅.
        We ask that you set aside your differences and remember at least one thing you have in common: You're here for us, and we LOVE you!
        </br>
        So, when you feel the need to bring up politics simply imagine the other person agreeing with you, and move on.
        If someone is baiting you, feel free to bring it up with us, and we will address the situation appropriately.
        </br>
        If you can't put it aside for a few hours, consider diversifying your interests
        and feel free to not attend.
