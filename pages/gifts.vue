          Honeymoon Trip to Japan

        We are into experiences, as such we are asking for gifts in the form of
        donations to our travel fund. We are planning a trip to Japan. In
        college we both took a class where we had to plan a vacation.
        Coincidentally, we both drew Japan out of a hat, and conducted quite a
        lot of research. So we have both independently planned our own ideal
        vacation to Japan. We can't imagine anything better than combining
        those plans for a honeymoon. While we are checking off those boxes, we will
        also be spending a few days with Jakob's sister Arielle
        and her family, who recently moved to Ota-Shi Gunma, Japan. We appreciate
        anything you can contribute to making this dream vacation a reality. Donate
        responsibly, and please don't feel like you have to give anything at
        all. Your presence is a present! If you would like to make a donation,
        follow this:
