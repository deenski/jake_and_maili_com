        We are into experiences, as such we are asking for gifts in the form of
        donations to our travel fund. We are planning a trip to Japan. In
        collegewe both took a class where we had to plan a trip.
        Coincedentially, we both drew Japan out of a hat. So we have both
        independently planned our own ideal trips to Japan. We will be combining
        those plans as well as spending a few days with Jakob's sister Arielle
        and her family, who recently moved to Ota-Shi Gunma Japan We appreciate
        anything you can contribute to making this experience possible. Donate
        responsibly, and please don't feel like you have to give anything at
        all. Your presence is a present! If you would like to make a donation,
        follow this:
